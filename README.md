# AI-based Research Assistant

## Overview
The **AI-based Research Assistant** is a web-based research tool that queries arXiv for academic papers based on user-input topics. It fetches and displays academic papers from arXiv in a user-friendly interface.
It is smart and AI-driven as it provides semantic searching.

## How is it better than arXiv itself?

- **Better UI & User Experience:** arXiv‚Äôs interface is outdated and text-heavy. It needs a modern makeover like the UI of market-holding websites like ResearchGate. This tool provides a modern, user-friendly design with a cleaner layout, intuitive search, and responsive design.
- **Curated & Structured Results:** arXiv lists results in a plain card-based format which is difficult to read. Our tool can display them in a clean easy-to-eye card-based layout with:
-- Title, authors, abstract (trimmed for readability).
-- Direct PDF button (instead of navigating multiple links).
-- Better categorization of results.

## Features
