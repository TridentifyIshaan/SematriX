# AI-based Research Assistant

## Overview
The **AI-based Research Assistant** is a web-based research tool that queries arXiv for academic papers based on user-input topics. It fetches and display academic papers from arXiv in a user-friendly interface.

This project enables businesses to efficiently manage their cloud infrastructure, prevent resource over-provisioning or under-provisioning, and save on cloud costs through dynamic, automated scaling.

## How is it better than arXiv itself?

- **Better UI & User Experience:** arXiv‚Äôs interface is outdated and text-heavy. It needs a modern makeover like the UI of market-holding websites like ResearchGate. This tool provides a modern, user-friendly design with a cleaner layout, intuitive search, and responsive design.
- **Curated & Structured Results:** arXiv lists results in a plain card-based format which is difficult to read. Our tool can display them in a clean easy-to-eye card-based layout with:
-- Title, authors, abstract (trimmed for readability).
-- Direct PDF button (instead of navigating multiple links).
-- Better categorization of results.

## Features
- **Demand Prediction**: Predicts cloud resource demand using AI models based on historical and real-time user data.
- **Auto-Scaling**: Automatically adjusts cloud resources to meet predicted demand.
- **Cost Optimization**: Minimizes cloud infrastructure costs by preventing unnecessary resource allocation.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Continuously tracks system performance and adjusts scaling in real-time.
- **Cloud Provider Integration**: Supports integration with major cloud platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure.

## Architecture
The system is composed of the following key components:
- **Data Collector**: Gathers historical usage data and real-time user activity.
- **AI Prediction Engine**: Utilizes machine learning algorithms (e.g., time-series forecasting, reinforcement learning) to predict future resource needs.
- **Cloud Resource Manager**: Interfaces with cloud providers to automatically scale resources.
- **Monitoring Module**: Tracks system performance and provides feedback for improving prediction accuracy.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-cloud-auto-scheduler.git
    cd ai-cloud-auto-scheduler
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Configure cloud provider credentials**:
   - For AWS: Set up your AWS credentials in `~/.aws/credentials`.
   - For GCP/Azure: Follow the respective setup guides to integrate API keys.

4. **Run the project**:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

## Usage
1. **Collect Data**: Ensure that historical usage data and real-time user activity are being fed into the system.
2. **Train Model**: Use the provided script to train the AI model on historical data:
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
3. **Auto-Scaling**: Deploy the auto-scaling service and let it handle resource management based on AI predictions.
**Configuration**
- Scaling thresholds: Define thresholds for resource scaling in config.yaml.
- Cloud Provider API: Update API configurations in the config.yaml file based on your cloud provider.
  
**Future Improvements**
- Support for multi-cloud integration (AWS, GCP, Azure).
- Enhanced prediction models incorporating additional metrics like network traffic and storage demand.
- Predictive maintenance to auto-detect resource failures.
